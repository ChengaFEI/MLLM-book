title: Bias-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation: Mitigating Catastrophic Inheritance of Large Language Models
key_work: Large Language Models, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Bias Mitigation, Catastrophic Inheritance
date of publish: August 8, 2024 
Core idea:
1. abstract:
This paper introduces Bias-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method designed to address the issue of Catastrophic Inheritance in large language models. BA-LoRA incorporates three regularization terms: consistency regularizer, diversity regularizer, and singular value decomposition regularizer. These terms aim to preserve pre-trained knowledge, promote diverse outputs, and enhance model generalization. Experiments across various natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate BA-LoRA's superiority over existing methods, particularly in mitigating biases from pre-training data.

2. gap of current research: 
While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA have addressed computational challenges, they do not fully address the issue of bias propagation from pre-training data. Existing methods struggle to mitigate the effects of noisy, imbalanced, or biased training data on downstream task performance.

3. innovation: 
BA-LoRA introduces three novel regularization terms:
- Consistency regularizer: Preserves valuable pre-trained knowledge during fine-tuning
- Diversity regularizer: Encourages varied model outputs and addresses imbalanced data issues
- Singular value decomposition (SVD) regularizer: Enhances model generalization capabilities
These regularizers are tailored differently for natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks to address their specific requirements.

4. method: 
BA-LoRA builds upon the Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation (PiSSA) method. It applies the three regularization terms during the fine-tuning process. The method is evaluated on various benchmarks for both NLU and NLG tasks, using models like LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa. The experiments compare BA-LoRA against full fine-tuning, LoRA, and PiSSA.

5. contribution: 
- Introduces BA-LoRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that outperforms existing approaches
- Demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating biases inherited from pre-training data
- Shows consistent performance improvements across various model sizes and types
- Provides a comprehensive evaluation on both NLU and NLG tasks
- Offers insights into addressing the challenge of Catastrophic Inheritance in large language models

title: Domain-Aware Fine-Tuning: Enhancing Neural Network Adaptability

key_work: Fine-tuning, Domain adaptation, Batch normalization, Feature distortion

date of publish: March 26, 2024 

Core idea:
1. abstract:
This paper introduces Domain-Aware Fine-Tuning (DAFT), a novel approach to mitigate feature distortion during fine-tuning of pre-trained neural networks. DAFT incorporates batch normalization conversion and integrates linear probing and fine-tuning. The batch normalization conversion method reduces modifications to the neural network during fine-tuning, while the integration of linear probing and fine-tuning allows for gradual adaptation of the feature extractor. Experiments demonstrate that DAFT outperforms baseline methods on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, effectively mitigating feature distortion.

2. gap of current research: 
Existing fine-tuning methods can lead to distortion of pre-trained feature extractors, which already possess strong generalization capabilities. Recent approaches like LP-FT have limitations in handling batch normalization layers during fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the initial linear probing stage in LP-FT optimizes the head layer with a feature extractor that has not been adapted to the target domain.

3. innovation: 
DAFT introduces two key innovations:
1) A batch normalization conversion technique that effectively mitigates feature distortion by reducing modifications to the neural network during fine-tuning.
2) Integration of linear probing and fine-tuning into a single stage, allowing the head layer to be optimized with gradually adapting features from the target domain.

4. method: 
DAFT consists of two main components:
1) Batch Normalization Conversion: This technique computes new batch normalization parameters and statistics using the target domain data, effectively aligning the pre-trained model with the target domain before fine-tuning begins.
2) Integrated LP-FT: This approach uses separate learning rates for the feature extractor and head layer, allowing for more effective optimization. It also employs zero initialization for the head layer to reduce the initial influence of gradients on the feature extractor.

5. contribution: 
- Introduces DAFT, a novel fine-tuning method that outperforms existing approaches on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets
- Proposes an effective batch normalization conversion technique to mitigate feature distortion
- Develops an integrated approach for linear probing and fine-tuning that allows for more effective adaptation to the target domain
- Demonstrates improved robustness against various types of corruptions
- Provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and pre-trained models, showing the effectiveness and generalizability of DAFT

title: Overcoming Dataset Bias in Machine Learning Models
key_work: Dataset bias, Machine learning, Neural networks, Data diversity, Neuron specialization
date of publish: February 21, 2022
Core idea:
1. abstract:
Researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and Fujitsu Ltd. investigated how machine learning models can overcome biases in training datasets.
